# ABET Constraint Essay

Our project – Kalliope - as a research assistance tool, faces several constraints across different areas. Economically, the project is restricted by budgetary limitations, as we rely on free or open-source tools like Python and NLP libraries. This approach minimizes costs but also limits the robustness of the final solution compared to proprietary, high-performance alternatives. Professionally, Kalliope provides a significant opportunity for our team members to exercise their skills in machine learning, natural language processing, and data science. 

Ethical considerations are also considered, as the project processes academic papers and must respect intellectual property rights, avoiding any misuse of proprietary research or plagiarism. Moreover, ensuring user privacy when managing sensitive research data is also our main priority is also one of our priorities.

Security concerns revolve around protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the academic data it processes. Private data must be protected and under no circumstances we – as the developers of the project – tampering or disclosing it. Security protocols will be utilized to facilitate user data protection.

Socially, Kalliope aims to enhance the research process for students and academics, contributing positively to educational outcomes, but it must remain inclusive and accessible across diverse demographics to avoid unintentionally widening the digital divide. These constraints shape the design and scope of the project, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach.

## Summary
Our project, Kalliope, faces constraints in these
