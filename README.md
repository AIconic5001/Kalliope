## Project Abstract:

Kalliope aims to revolutionize the academic research landscape by providing an intelligent, user-centric tool for literature discovery and application. Unlike existing tools, our application not only identifies relevant research but also generates concise synopses for each paper, empowering users to quickly grasp essential insights and make well-informed decisions.

## Project Description

The Kalliope project aims to transform academic research through an AI-driven platform that enhances literature discovery and understanding. Leveraging arXiv for data and Google Colab for model training, Kalliope uses PySpark for large-scale processing, Flask for API management, and SQL for data storage to support synopsis generation and personalized recommendations. A frontend built with React, TypeScript, Material UI, and Tailwind ensures a responsive user experience, with Postman facilitating API testing. This comprehensive tech stack enables researchers to explore complex literature, share insights, and foster collaboration in an accessible academic environment.â€‹

#### Project Goals

- **Streamline Research Process**: Enable researchers, students, and professionals to access and digest academic content efficiently through automatically generated synopses and relevant recommendations.
- **Innovative Recommendation Engine**: Facilitate literature discovery with features like Related Paper Suggestions and Reverse Recommendation, allowing users to find research based on specific queries.
- **Collaboration and Sharing**: Support collaborative research efforts by enabling users to save, share, and discuss collections of related papers, fostering a connected academic community.
- **Increase Research Accessibility**: Simplify complex academic literature through synopses, making knowledge more accessible across disciplines and expertise levels.

#### Potential Features:
- Research Paper Synopsis (NLP)
- Related Papers Recommendation
- Reverse Recommendation (Query-to-Paper Matching)
- Save Related Papers
- Collaborations and Sharings

## User Stories and Design Diagrams 
#### User Stories:
- As a researcher, I want to quickly generate a synopsis of an academic paper, so that I can efficiently determine if the paper is relevant to my research.
- As an academic instructor, I want to search for research questions so that I can find the most relevant materials to back up my studies.
- As a graduate student, I want to receive recommendations for related papers after reading one, so that I can discover additional resources that support my topic.
- As an author, I want to receive recommendations for related papers based on my draft, so that I can ensure my work is comprehensive and well-supported by existing research.
- As a research team member, I want to share papers with my team so that we can collaborate more effectively by having access to the same resources.
