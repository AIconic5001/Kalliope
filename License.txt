Licenses for Research Data
What licence should be applied to the research data?
It depends on what rights protect your research data, if at all. In the light of what is explained in the guide "How do I know if my research data is protected?":

If your research data qualifies as a work (literary work such as a journal article or a software), then CC BY 4.0 is usually the best choice. The use of the Share Alike (SA) is also compatible with the Open Access definition and reinforced in Plan S licensing guidance for publications. Non-commercial should be avoided as it is not Open Access compliant. Non-derivative is a tricky issue and should be avoided, especially if you do not know what you are doing. That said, it may not be incompatible with the Open Access definition.
If your research data is a database or a dataset (unstructured data that do not meet the database definition) usually the best option is a CC0, which waives all your rights in the database.
Keep in mind that CC licences only deal with copyright and copyright related matter. Personal data are not included in CC and are analysed separately.

What is a Creative Commons licence?
Creative Commons, a global not-for-profit organisation which provides legal tools to promote the sharing and reuse of works of authorship, has produced a number of licences some of which meet the criteria for Open Access. These offer different levels of permission.

Creative Commons offers licences readable at three different levels: legal, machine (the metadata) and human (non-legal descriptions). Creative Commons has a useful tool to help you determine the licence best for you. More restrictive CC licences are unlikely to meet Open Access requirements (e.g. because they impose restrictions on commercial use).

Creative Commons (CC) Website: creativecommons.org provides detailed information about the different Creative Commons licenses (e.g., CC BY, CC0) and how they apply to content like research papers.

Open Access Journal Platforms:

PubMed Central: Offers access to numerous open-access research articles, many of which are under CC licenses.
arXiv: Preprints in various fields of science, mathematics, and computer science, often with clear usage rights.
DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals): Lists open-access journals that may have permissive licenses.
Public Domain Resources:

Project Gutenberg: For texts that have entered the public domain.
HathiTrust Digital Library: A repository of public domain content and academic resources.
Institutional Repositories: Many universities have their own repositories with research papers and datasets under varying licenses. Examples include:

Harvard DASH: Harvard University's open-access repository.
MIT DSpace: MIT's institutional repository.
Data and Research Communities:

Zenodo: An open-access repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN, where you can find research data with clear licensing.
Kaggle Datasets: Many of these datasets are public and include information about their licenses for reuse.
1. Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)
Description: This license allows you to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the work, even for commercial purposes, as long as you credit the original creator and license any new creations under the identical terms.
Key Requirements:
Must give appropriate credit.
Derivatives must be licensed under CC BY-SA.
Common Use: This license is used by Wikipedia and many other projects that want to ensure derivative works remain free and open.
2. GNU General Public License (GPL)
Description: The GPL is a copyleft license primarily used for software. It allows for free use, modification, and distribution of software, but requires that any modified versions also be released under the GPL.
Key Requirements:
Any derivative software must also be licensed under GPL.
Must provide access to the source code.
Common Use: Widely used in open-source software, including projects like Linux and WordPress.
3. GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)
Description: A variant of the GPL that includes an additional requirement: if the software is used over a network (e.g., SaaS), the source code must also be made available to users interacting with it over the network.
Key Requirements:
Any software distributed or offered as a service must be released under AGPL.
Source code must be accessible to users interacting with the software.
Common Use: Used in web-based software, particularly in situations where software is run as a service (SaaS).
4. Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA)
Description: This license allows you to remix, adapt, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as you credit the original creator and license any new works under identical terms.
Key Requirements:
Derivative works must be non-commercial.
Attribution and ShareAlike clause must be maintained.
Common Use: Used by creators who want to ensure their work is freely available for non-commercial purposes and that derivatives remain open.
5. Mozilla Public License (MPL)
Description: This is a middle-ground license that allows derivative works, but only requires that changes to licensed files be shared under the same MPL terms. It doesn't require the entire derivative project to be open-source, just the specific files that were modified.
Key Requirements:
Modifications to original files must be licensed under MPL.
Other parts of the project may be under a different license.
Common Use: Typically used for software where developers want flexibility in how the code is used but ensure that modifications to original files remain open.
6. Open Database License (ODbL)
Description: This license applies to databases. It allows users to freely share, modify, and use the data, but requires that any derivatives (such as new databases) also be shared under the ODbL.
Key Requirements:
Share-Alike requirement for modified databases.
Common Use: Used in open data projects like OpenStreetMap.
Key Principles of Share-Alike (SA) Licenses:
Modification Allowed: You can modify and build upon the original work.
Same Licensing for Derivatives: Any derivative works must be shared under the same or compatible Share-Alike license.
Promotes Open Culture: Ensures that any improvements or adaptations remain freely available to the public.

3. MIT License
This is a very permissive license that allows you to use, modify, and distribute the work, even commercially, as long as the original license and copyright notice are included.
4. BSD License (Berkeley Software Distribution)
There are different versions (2-Clause and 3-Clause), but generally, the BSD license allows you to use, modify, and distribute the work with minimal restrictions. It requires attribution but doesn't impose further conditions on how the work is used.
5. Open Data Commons Licenses
ODC Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL): A public domain license that allows unrestricted use of data.
ODC Attribution License (ODC-By): Allows use, modification, and distribution of data, provided attribution is given to the original source.
ODC Open Database License (ODbL): Similar to the ODC-By license but requires that derivative databases also remain open and freely available under the same terms.
6. EUPL (European Union Public License)
This license allows the use, modification, and redistribution of the work, with some provisions to ensure compatibility with other open-source licenses.
7. Proprietary Licenses with Explicit AI Usage Terms
Some publishers or authors may provide proprietary licenses that explicitly permit AI training or data mining. Always check terms that define usage for machine learning or AI model training.
8. Dataset-Specific Licenses
Some research datasets come with custom licenses that explicitly allow or restrict AI-related uses. Examples include the Common Crawl license for web data and Hugging Faceâ€™s dataset licenses.
9. CC BY-NC (Non-Commercial)
Allows the use of the work for non-commercial purposes, with proper attribution, but restricts commercial use.
10. Fair Use (U.S.)
Under certain conditions, research papers can be used for training AI models under the doctrine of fair use (e.g., for non-commercial, transformative purposes). However, this can be legally complex and should be approached with caution.
11. MPL (Mozilla Public License)
A compromise between permissive and copyleft licenses. You can use and modify the work freely, but any modified files must be distributed under the same license.
It's important to always verify the terms of each license, especially in how they apply to AI training and commercial applications.
